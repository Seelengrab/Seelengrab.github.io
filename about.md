@def title = "About"

Hello there! I'm Sukera.

I'm an avid julia users (started in ~2017, right around the transition from 0.5 to 0.6), performance enthusiast and otherwise interested-in-all-kinds-of-things person. I've previously also used Java, C#, C, C++, python and a tiny bit of HLSL.

I spend a large amount of my free time helping people on the internet with the technical difficulties they encounter when using
julia, ranging from performance to design & code architectural issues.

I'm currently employed as a system administrator who also does some devops, but I've previously also worked as a software engineer.
There also was a time where I was teaching Java to first & second semester undergrad students in the form of a tutoring position.
The views, opinions and all other stuff on here are my own.
