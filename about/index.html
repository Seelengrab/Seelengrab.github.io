I&#39;ve previously also used Java, C#, C, C&#43;&#43;, Python and a tiny bit of HLSL.</p> <p>I spend a large amount of my free time helping people on the internet with the technical difficulties they encounter when using Julia, ranging from performance to design &amp; code architectural issues. I specialize in making code go fast, no matter the language, as long as there&#39;s a way to profile it. Sometimes this requires restructuring existing code or architecting a new solution, depending on the severity of the issue, which is part of the fun&#33; In recent times I&#39;ve also dabbled a bit in compilers and thinking about static compilation in Julia, and I&#39;m also the maintainer of <a href="https://github.com/Seelengrab/PropCheck.jl">PropCheck.jl</a>, a property based testing framework/fuzzer for Julia.</p> <p>If what I wrote above and/or what I write about in my blogposts sounds interesting to you, feel free to contact me under <code>valentin &#40;at-symbol&#41; bogad &#40;dot-mark&#41; at</code>. I&#39;ve previously worked as a software engineer and also as system administrator. There also was a time where I was teaching Java to first &amp; second semester undergrad students in the form of a tutoring position.
