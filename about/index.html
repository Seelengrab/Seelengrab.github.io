I&#39;ve previously also used Java, C#, C, C&#43;&#43;, python and a tiny bit of HLSL.</p> <p>I spend a large amount of my free time helping people on the internet with the technical difficulties they encounter when using julia, ranging from performance to design &amp; code architectural issues.</p> <p>I&#39;m currently employed as a system administrator who also does some devops, but I&#39;ve previously also worked as a software engineer. There also was a time where I was teaching Java to first &amp; second semester undergrad students in the form of a tutoring position.
